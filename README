TabULater Chrome extension version 0.3.1 (primary tabbed mode)

To-do:
- Design/styling, user interface, and instructions improvements
	- Bootstrap website updates; app hosted on website w/ bootstrap format
- Extension stores its state so it doesn't get wiped every time it gets closed
	{sort of implemented via tabbed/web mode}
- Sessions implemented; some way to organize tabs
	(possible jQuery commands: draggable, sortable, accordion, etc.)
	(i.e. see code academy jQuery section 5)
	(going along with this, booting multiple tabs at once)
	(see chrome.tabs query command, possibly place existing tabs in app)
- Official distribution through Chrome App Store

Distant Future
