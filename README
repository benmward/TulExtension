TabULater Chrome extension version 2.0 (general linking functionality)

To-do:
- Design/styling, user interface, and instructions improvements
- Silently adding "https://www." when needed (regex)
- Make the "X" delete the line
- Extension stores its state so it doesn't get wiped every time it gets closed
	(perhaps use output file [see loading of x in popup.js] to store state)
- Sessions implemented; some way to organize tabs
	(possible jQuery commands: draggable, sortable, accordion, etc.)
	(i.e. see code academy jQuery section 5)
	(going along with this, booting multiple tabs at once)
